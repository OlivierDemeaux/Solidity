# First interview for Offchain Labs

The DaoEscrowFarm.sol is a contract with many flaws that, as a assignment, I needed to study and exploit.
Here is my response to it. (See MyAssessment.docx)

I spend a lot of time on it and couln't find the reentrancy. Was pretty mad at myself for not getting it.
During the interview, the recruteur that made the challenge realised it got it wrong and the reentrancy is actually impossible, which made me feel a lot better since the issue wasn't with me.

I was invited to the next round of interviews.
