# DK technical interview

Technical interview I did for DK end of January.
Had one hour to code a smart contract to bet on game that a moderator would give the result to,
and the ETH bet would be distributed amoung the betters.

Had a blast while coding it so re wrote it from memory and added to it what I thought about but ran out of time during the interview itself.

ToDo: 
    - Need to add event
    - Need to add hardhat testing



Notes: Went through all the interviews, was told I should expect an offer, but less than 24h later was told that the role changed and they were looking for someone with more experience..
