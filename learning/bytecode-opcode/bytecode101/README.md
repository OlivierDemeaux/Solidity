## Dissection EVM bytecode
# Compile contract and returned bytecode

A very simple contract:
```
contract ruturnOpcode {
    constructor() public payable {

    }

}
```
once compiled, will return a bytecode. In this example, this contract will return
```
6080604052603f8060116000396000f3fe6080604052600080fdfea26469706673582212209da86916af98aae2b88dd73cde282a5e66f3106301696607b02046b8e1bf6f0164736f6c63430007000033
```

# Bytecode Basics
The EVM uses a set of instructions (called opcodes) to execute specific tasks. At the time of writing, there are 140 unique opcodes. Together, these opcodes allow the EVM to be Turing-complete. This means the EVM is able to compute (almost) anything, given enough resources. Because opcodes are 1 byte, there can only be a maximum of 256 (16Â²) opcodes. For simplicity's sake, we can split all opcodes into the following categories:
Stack-manipulating opcodes (POP, PUSH, DUP, SWAP)
Arithmetic/comparison/bitwise opcodes (ADD, SUB, GT, LT, AND, OR)
Environmental opcodes (CALLER, CALLVALUE, NUMBER)
Memory-manipulating opcodes (MLOAD, MSTORE, MSTORE8, MSIZE)
Storage-manipulating opcodes (SLOAD, SSTORE)
Program counter related opcodes (JUMP, JUMPI, PC, JUMPDEST)
Halting opcodes (STOP, RETURN, REVERT, INVALID, SELFDESTRUCT)

# First part

Every compiled Smart Contract bytecode start with 6080604052.
Opcode 60 is 'push1', so it push the next byte to the stack. 80 is now at position 00 of the stack.
Again, opcode 60, push1, with 40, so now 40 is at 00 of stack and 80 is at 01.
Opcode 52, 'mstore', store in memory the second value of the stack at the address that is the first value of the stack, which means that mstore stores value '80' at address ('40' + 32bytes) and burns those 2 values. So now the stack is empty and memory slot 0x50 has the value '0x00000000000000000000000000000080'.
So '6080604052' is 'PUSH1 0x60 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE'

# Second part

The second part of this bytecode is 603f8060116000396000f3fe.  
Opcode 60, 'push1', pushes byte 3f (value 63) to the empty stack.  
Opcode 80, 'dup1', clones the last value of the stack, so now the stack has 3f at location 0 and 1.  
Opcode 60, 'push1', pushes byte 11 (value 17) to the stack. Stack is now 11, 3f, 3f.  
Opcode 60, 'push1', pushes byte 00 to the stack. Stack is now 00, 11, 3f, 3f.  
Opcode 39, 'codecopy', takes the 3 lowest value of the stack (00 (destOffset), 11 (offset), 3f (length)), burns them, and copy the code like so: 'memory[destOffset:destOffset+length] = address(this).code[offset:offset+length]', so it copies to memory from location 00 to 3f the code from the calldata from position 11 to 11+3f.  
So bytes from value 18 to 18+63 = 81 from the calldata:  
6080604052600080fdfea26469706673582212209da86916af98aae2b88dd73cde282a5e66f3106301696607b02046b8e1bf6f0164736f6c63430007000033
are now in the memory and the stack is now 3f.  
Opcode 60, 'push1', pushes byte 00 to the stack.  
Opcode f3, 'return', returns byte 'fe' which is opcode for 'invalid'.
