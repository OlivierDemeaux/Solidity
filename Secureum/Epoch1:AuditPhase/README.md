## Audit Phase
Got into the Top128 of the bootcamp participants, so I'm selected for the 2nd phase of the bootcamp, the audit phase.

I was assigned to audit the Sherlock Protocol
website - https://sherlock.xyz/
twitter - https://twitter.com/sherlockdefi
Contracts - https://docs.sherlock.xyz/developers/deployed-contracts

Will start looking the protocol tomorrow.

# Audit duration and content
Audit will go from December 5th to December 17th.

The final commit is 877056fd1d30aa2d74db7f673ee289ddc75e449f @ https://github.com/sherlock-protocol/sherlock-v2-core,
The docs can be found @ https://sherlock-protocol.gitbook.io/sherlock-v2/, the developer section at the bottom is a good read when trying to understand the code.
