# Secureum

Secureum is a bootcamp for Smart Contract Auditing that started on October 1st 2021.

There is 2 phases for the bootcamp:
- Learning phase, from Oct to Nov, that covers 8 topics (Ethereum101, Solidity101, Solidity201, Pitfall and Best Practices 101, ...) that is a eliminatory phase from 1024 participants down to only 101 that will be selected for phase 2.
- Audit-Readiness phase, all of December, 4 topics.

## Reason to participate
I'm actually super excited to be in the bootcamp. Smart Contract Auditing is a vital step of any Smart Contract developpement and too often are Smart Contract rushed in production with significant bugs in them that allow a hacker to get away with millions of $$. Compagnies will add substential values to their protocol by having a developpeur in house that specialize in Smart Contract auditing and I will be able to add value with my audit skills.

## Tests
Every week there is a 32 questions tests. The first test surprised me by hom difficulte it was and that pushed me to really study for the second one. I hope I will keep it up.
- test #1 (ethereum101): 23/32(72%), not bad but not great (535 participants took this quiz, average score was 18.7/32, highest was 30/32, 216 got >64%.)
- test #2 (solidity101): 25/32(78%), pretty good (471 participants took this quiz, average score was 14.4/32, average duration was 15:20, highest was 29/32, 101 got > 64% (> 20/32).)
- test #3 (solidity201): 24/32(75%), pretty good (378 participants took this quiz, average score was 13.5/32, average duration was 14:43, highest was 27/32, 54 got > 64% (> 20/32).), was a complicated week getting into details of the EVM functioning .
- test #4 (pitfall and best practices 101): /32.

## Reasons to maintain this repo
As I update this repo, I will go back on the quizzes and my answers and review it all, forcing me to go over the material once more.

## Goals
Learn Smart Contract Auditing, EVM in and out functionning and secrets.
