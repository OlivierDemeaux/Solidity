# Secureum

Secureum is a bootcamp for Smart Contract Auditing that started on October 1st 2021.

There is 2 phases for the bootcamp:
- Learning phase, from Oct to Nov, that covers 8 topics (Ethereum101, Solidity101, Solidity201, Pitfall and Best Practices 101, ...) that is a eliminatory phase from 1024 participants down to only 101 that will be selected for phase 2.
- Audit-Readiness phase, all of December, 4 topics.

## Reason to participate
I'm actually super excited to be in the bootcamp. Smart Contract Auditing is a vital step of any Smart Contract developpement and too often are Smart Contract rushed in production with significant bugs in them that allow a hacker to get away with millions of $$. Compagnies will add substential values to their protocol by having a developpeur in house that specialize in Smart Contract auditing and I will be able to add value with my audit skills.

## Tests
Every week there is a 32 questions tests. The first test surprised me by hom difficulte it was and that pushed me to really study for the second one. I hope I will keep it up.
- test #1 (ethereum101): 23/32(72%), not bad but not great (535 participants took this quiz, average score was 18.7/32, highest was 30/32, 216 got >64%.)
- test #2 (solidity101): 25/32(78%), pretty good (471 participants took this quiz, average score was 14.4/32, average duration was 15:20, highest was 29/32, 101 got > 64% (> 20/32).)
- test #3 (solidity201): 24/32(75%), pretty good (378 participants took this quiz, average score was 13.5/32, average duration was 14:43, highest was 27/32, 54 got > 64% (> 20/32).), was a complicated week getting into details of the EVM functioning.
- test #4 (pitfall and best practices 101): 9/16(56%), not as good as I was hoping for but I didn't study as much as I should have so not surprised (343 participants took this quiz, average score was 7.8/16, average duration was 14:36, highest was 16/16, 81 got > 64% (> 10/16).)
- test #5 (pitfall and best practices 201): 6/8(75%), missed 2 questions on lack of attention errors, pretty mad at myself. (308 participants took this quiz, average score was 4.4/8, average duration was 13:18, highest was 8/8, 114 got > 64% (> 5/8)).
- test #6 (Audit techniques & tools 101): 13/16(81%), missed a few debatable questions but happy with the result (265 participants took this quiz, average score was 11.7/16, average duration was 12:20, highest was 16/16, 187 got > 64% (> 10/16)).
- test #7 (Audit findings 101): 8/8(100%), obviously, really happy with that one.
- test #8 (Audit finding 201): 5/8 (62.5%), not great, could have done better if I studied more.

## Tests Results
23 + 25 + 24 + (9*2) + (6*4) + (13*2) + (8*4) + (5*4) = 192 / 256 pts (75%). Not bad overall, could have done better.
Now we wait to see if I'm in the top 128. So far I'm top 50. There is still 2 tests to be counted for but I got 100% and 62.5% on those tests so I should be fine.

## Reasons to maintain this repo
As I update this repo, I will go back on the quizzes and my answers and review it all, forcing me to go over the material once more.

## Goals
Learn Smart Contract Auditing, EVM in and out functionning and secrets.

## Files and Repo
The files are organized in 2 parts:
    - Epoch0 that represent the 8 weeks learning phase of 8 slots(weeks).
    - Epoch1 that represent the Audit phase of 4 slots(weeks).
