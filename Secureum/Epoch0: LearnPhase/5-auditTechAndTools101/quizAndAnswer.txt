[Q1] Which of the below is/are accurate?
(A): Audits identify all security vulnerabilities and guarantee bug-free code
(B): Audits cover only smart contracts but never the offchain code
(C): Audits suggest fixes for issues identified and aim to reduce risk
(D): None of the above
[Answers]: C
[Q2] Audit reports from audit firms typically include
(A): Finding likelihood/difficulty, impact and severity
(B): Exploit scenarios and recommended fixes
(C): Formal verification of all findings with proofs and counterexamples
(D): All of the above
[Answers]: A,B
[Q3] These audit techniques are especially well-suited for smart contracts (compared to Web2 programs)
(A): Formal verification because contracts are relatively smaller with specific properties
(B): Fuzzing because anyone can send random inputs to contracts on blockchain
(C): Static source-code analysis because contracts are expected to be open-source
(D): High-coverage testing because contract states and transitions are relatively fewer
[Answers]: A,B,C,D
[Q4] The following kinds of findings may be expected during audits
(A): True positives after confirmation from the project team
(B): False positives due to assumptions from missing specification and threat model
(C): False negatives due to limitations of time and expertise
(D): None of the above
[Answers]: A,B,C
[Q5] Which of the following is/are true?
(A): Audited projects always have clear/complete specification and documentation of all contract properties
(B): Manual analysis is typically required for detecting application logic vulnerabilities
(C): Automated tools like Slither and MythX have no false negatives
(D): The project team always fixes all the findings identified in audits
[Answers]: B
[Q6] Automated tools for smart contract analysis
(A): Are sufficient therefore making manual analysis unnecessary
(B): Have no false positives whatsoever
(C): Are best-suited for application-level vulnerabilities
(D): None of the above
[Answers]: D
[Q7] Which of the following is/are true?
(A): Slither supports detectors, printers, tools and custom analyses
(B): Echidna is a symbolic analyzer tool
(C): MythX is a combination of static analysis, symbolic checking and fuzzing tools
(D): None of the above
[Answers]: A,C
[Q8] Which of the following is/are correct about false positives?
(A): They are findings that are not real concerns/vulnerabilities after further review
(B): They are real vulnerabilities but are falsely claimed by auditors as benign
(C): They are possible with automated tools
(D): None of the above
[Answers]: A,C
[Q9] Audit findings
(A): May include both specific vulnerabilities and generic recommendations
(B): May not all be fixed by the project team for reasons of relevancy and acceptable trust/threat model
(C): Always have demonstrable proof-of-concept exploit code on mainnet
(D): None of the above
[Answers]: A,B
[Q10] Which of the following is/are typical manual review approach(es)?
(A): Asset flow
(B): Symbolic checking
(C): Inferring constraints
(D): Evaluating assumptions
[Answers]: A,C,D
[Q11] Access control analysis is a critical part of manual review for the reason(s) that
(A): It is the easiest to perform because smart contracts never have access control
(B): It is the fastest to perform because there are always only two roles: users and admins
(C): It is fundamental to security because privileged roles (of which there may be many) may be misused/compromised
(D): None of the above
[Answers]: C
[Q12] Which of the following is/are true about vulnerability difficulty and impact?
(A): Difficulty indicates how hard it was for auditors to detect the issue
(B): Difficulty is an objective measure that can always be quantified
(C): Impact is typically classified as High if there is loss/lock of funds
(D): None of the above
[Answers]: C
[Q13] Application-level security constraints
(A): Are always clearly/completely specified and documented
(B): Have to be typically inferred from the code or discussions with project team
(C): Typically require manual analysis
(D): None of the above
[Answers]: B,C
[Q14] Which of the following is/are typically true?
(A): Static analysis analyzes program properties by actually executing the program
(B): Fuzzing uses valid, expected and deterministic inputs
(C): Symbolic checking enumerates individual states/transitions for efficient state space traversal
(D): None of the above
[Answers]: D
[Q15] Which of the following is/are generally true about asset flow analysis?
(A): Analyzes the flow of Ether or tokens managed by smart contracts
(B): Assets should be withdrawn only by authorized addresses
(C): The timing aspects of asset withdrawals/deposits is irrelevant
(D): The type and quantity of asset withdrawals/deposits is irrelevant
[Answers]: A,B
[Q16] Which of the following is/are generally true about control and data flow analyses?
(A): Interprocedural control flow is typically indicated by a call graph
(B): Intraprocedural control flow is dictated by conditionals (if/else), loops (for/while/do/continue/break) and return statements
(C): Interprocedural data flow is evaluated by analyzing the data used as argument values for function parameters at call sites
(D): Intraprocedural data flow is evaluated by analyzing the assignment and use of variables/constants along control flow paths within functions
[Answers]: A,B,C,D
